- **$Z^*$ : Zero-shot Style Transfer via Attention Rearrangement** [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16491)] [[code](https://github.com/HolmesShuan/Zero-shot-Style-Transfer-via-Attention-Rearrangement)]
  
  Z-STAR is an innovative zero-shot (training-free) style transfer method that leverages the generative prior knowledge within a pre-trained diffusion model. By employing an attention rearrangement strategy, it effectively fuses content and style information without the need for retraining or tuning for each input style.
